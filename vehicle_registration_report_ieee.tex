\begin{abstract}
In the current traffic management and security system, the manual verification of vehicle registration status is inefficient, time-consuming, and prone to errors. This paper presents an intelligent vehicle registration verification system using computer vision and machine learning techniques that automates the process of identifying registered and unregistered vehicles through license plate recognition. The system employs a multi-stage approach for license plate detection and text extraction using enhanced OCR techniques with both EasyOCR and Pytesseract as backup. Character-level TF-IDF vectorization is applied to the extracted text, followed by classification using various machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost. Performance evaluation shows that the XGBoost classifier achieves the highest accuracy of 95.3\% in distinguishing between registered and unregistered vehicles. A dual web interface using Gradio and Streamlit frameworks provides user-friendly access with both automatic and manual input options. The system addresses challenges in OCR accuracy through multi-stage image enhancement techniques and provides a fallback mechanism for manual text entry when automatic detection fails. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of vehicle registration verification while offering a scalable solution for traffic management and security applications.

\section{Introduction}
Vehicle registration verification is a critical component of traffic management, law enforcement, and security systems. Traditional methods of verifying vehicle registration typically involve manual checks by enforcement officers, which are time-consuming, inefficient, and prone to human errors. With the increasing number of vehicles on the road, there is a growing need for automated and intelligent systems that can quickly and accurately verify vehicle registration status \cite{islam2021Blockchain}.

Recent advancements in computer vision and machine learning technologies have opened new possibilities for automating the vehicle registration verification process. License plate recognition (LPR) systems have become increasingly popular for applications such as traffic monitoring, parking management, and toll collection. However, existing LPR systems often focus solely on identifying the license plate number without further verifying its registration status \cite{kumar2023exploring}.

This paper presents an intelligent vehicle registration verification system that combines computer vision techniques for license plate detection and optical character recognition (OCR) with machine learning algorithms for registration status classification. The system automates the process of identifying registered and unregistered vehicles, providing a more efficient and accurate alternative to manual verification methods.

The main contributions of this paper are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Development of a robust multi-stage approach for license plate detection and text extraction combining multiple OCR engines and image enhancement techniques
    \item Implementation of character-level TF-IDF vectorization for effective feature engineering of license plate text
    \item Comparative evaluation of various machine learning algorithms for registration status classification
    \item Creation of dual user interfaces using Gradio and Streamlit frameworks for practical deployment
    \item Introduction of a manual input option as a fallback when automatic text extraction fails
\end{itemize}

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II discusses related work in the field of license plate recognition and vehicle registration verification. Section III presents the methodology of the proposed system, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and web interface development. Section IV provides experimental results and performance evaluation. Section V discusses challenges faced and solutions implemented. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper and suggests directions for future work.

\section{Related Work}
License plate recognition and vehicle verification systems have been an active area of research in recent years. Various approaches have been proposed for different stages of the process, including license plate detection, character segmentation, optical character recognition, and verification.

Khazaee et al. \cite{khazaee2020} proposed a method for license plate detection using a two-stage convolutional neural network (CNN). Their approach achieved high accuracy in detecting license plates under various lighting conditions and angles. However, their work did not extend to registration verification after plate detection.

In the field of OCR for license plate recognition, Silva and Jung \cite{silva2018} developed a method using a combination of image preprocessing techniques and a deep learning-based character recognition model. Their system achieved an accuracy of 93.5\% in recognizing license plate characters. However, they noted challenges with certain character combinations and varying plate formats.

For vehicle verification purposes, Wang et al. \cite{wang2019} proposed a system that uses license plate recognition combined with a database lookup to verify vehicle attributes. Their system achieved an accuracy of 91.2\% in verifying vehicle information but was limited by the quality of the license plate images and OCR accuracy.

More recently, Zhang et al. \cite{zhang2021} introduced a vehicle registration verification system using deep learning. Their system incorporated a YOLOv4-based license plate detector and a CNN-based OCR model, achieving an accuracy of 94.1\% in registration verification. However, their system required high-quality images and struggled with poor lighting conditions.

Several commercial systems for vehicle registration verification exist, such as those developed by companies like Rekor Systems and PlateSmart. These systems typically combine license plate recognition with database lookups to verify registration status. However, they often require expensive hardware and specialized cameras, limiting their accessibility.

Despite these advancements, existing systems still face challenges in accurately detecting and reading license plates under varying conditions, efficiently processing the extracted text, and providing user-friendly interfaces for practical deployment. Additionally, most systems do not offer fallback mechanisms when automatic detection fails, limiting their reliability in real-world scenarios.

Our work addresses these limitations by implementing a multi-stage approach for license plate detection and OCR, utilizing character-level TF-IDF vectorization for effective feature engineering, comparing various machine learning algorithms for classification, and providing dual user interfaces with manual input options as a fallback mechanism.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{System Overview}
The proposed intelligent vehicle registration verification system consists of five main components: image acquisition, license plate detection, text extraction using OCR, feature engineering and classification, and web interface implementation. Fig. \ref{fig:system_overview} illustrates the overall architecture of the proposed system.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/system_architecture.png}
\caption{Overall architecture of the proposed vehicle registration verification system}
\label{fig:system_overview}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Dataset Description}
The dataset used in this work consists of vehicle images categorized as either "Registered" or "Unregistered" based on their registration status. The dataset is structured as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Registered:} Contains images of vehicles with valid registration
    \item \textbf{Unregistered:} Contains images of vehicles with invalid or expired registration
\end{itemize}

Each image in the dataset is associated with a text file containing the license plate number. The dataset structure is organized as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
Registered/
    Vehicle0.jpg
    Vehicle0.txt
    Vehicle1.jpg
    Vehicle1.txt
    ...
Unregistered/
    Vehicle2000.jpg
    Vehicle2000.txt
    Vehicle2001.jpg
    Vehicle2001.txt
    ...
\end{lstlisting}

This structured dataset enables supervised learning for the classification task while providing the necessary images for testing the license plate detection and OCR components of the system.

\subsection{License Plate Detection}
For license plate detection, we implemented a multi-stage approach utilizing contour analysis and geometric filtering. The detection process consists of the following steps:

\begin{algorithm}[h]
\caption{License Plate Detection Algorithm}
\label{alg:lp_detection}
\scriptsize
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Procedure{DetectLicensePlate}{$image$}
    \State $enhanced\_images \gets$ EnhanceImageForOCR($image$)
    \State $potential\_plates \gets$ []
    
    \For{$img\_type$ in ["bilateral", "gray"]}
        \State $processed \gets enhanced\_images[img\_type]$
        \State $edged \gets$ CannyEdgeDetection($processed$)
        \State $contours \gets$ FindContours($edged$)
        \State Sort $contours$ by area, largest first
        
        \For{$contour$ in $contours$ (top 10)}
            \State $perimeter \gets$ ArcLength($contour$)
            \State $approx \gets$ ApproxPolyDP($contour$, $0.018 \times perimeter$)
            
            \If{$len(approx) = 4$}
                \State $(x, y, w, h) \gets$ BoundingRect($contour$)
                \State $aspect\_ratio \gets w / h$
                
                \If{$1.5 \leq aspect\_ratio \leq 5.0$}
                    \State $roi \gets$ ExtractROI($image$, $x$, $y$, $w$, $h$)
                    \State $score \gets$ CalculateScore($image$, $x$, $y$, $w$, $h$)
                    \State Add \{$roi$, $score$, $(x, y, w, h)$\} to $potential\_plates$
                \EndIf
            \EndIf
        \EndFor
    \EndFor
    
    \State Sort $potential\_plates$ by $score$
    \State \Return Top 3 elements of $potential\_plates$
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/plate_detection.png}
\caption{License plate detection process: (a) Original image, (b) Edge detection, (c) Contour analysis, (d) Detected license plate}
\label{fig:plate_detection}
\end{figure}

The CalculateScore function prioritizes potential license plates based on their position in the image and aspect ratio, with higher scores given to regions in the center of the image with appropriate dimensions for license plates.

\subsection{Text Extraction using OCR}
To extract text from the detected license plate regions, we implemented a multi-engine approach combining EasyOCR and Pytesseract with various image enhancement techniques to improve OCR accuracy. The text extraction process consists of the following steps:

\begin{algorithm}[h]
\caption{Text Extraction Algorithm}
\label{alg:text_extraction}
\scriptsize
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Procedure{ExtractPlateText}{$image$}
    \State $potential\_plates \gets$ DetectLicensePlate($image$)
    \State $all\_results \gets$ [], $all\_confidences \gets$ []
    
    \For{$plate$ in $potential\_plates$}
        \State $plate\_img \gets plate.roi$
        \State $enhanced\_images \gets$ EnhanceImageForOCR($plate\_img$)
        
        \If{EasyOCR is available}
            \For{$img\_type, enhanced\_img$ in $enhanced\_images$}
                \State $ocr\_results \gets$ EasyOCRRead($enhanced\_img$)
                \For{$result$ in $ocr\_results$}
                    \State $text \gets result.text$, $confidence \gets result.confidence$
                    \State $cleaned\_text \gets$ CleanPlateText($text$)
                    \If{$cleaned\_text$ is valid}
                        \State Add $cleaned\_text$ to $all\_results$
                        \State Add $confidence$ to $all\_confidences$
                    \EndIf
                \EndFor
            \EndFor
        \EndIf
        
        \If{Pytesseract is available}
            \For{$img\_type$ in ["gray", "threshold", "enhanced"]}
                \State $text \gets$ PytesseractRead($enhanced\_images[img\_type]$)
                \State $cleaned\_text \gets$ CleanPlateText($text$)
                \If{$cleaned\_text$ is valid}
                    \State Add $cleaned\_text$ to $all\_results$
                    \State Add 0.7 to $all\_confidences$ \Comment{Default confidence}
                \EndIf
            \EndFor
        \EndIf
    \EndFor
    
    \State \Return SelectBestResult($all\_results$, $all\_confidences$)
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The CleanPlateText function normalizes the extracted text by converting to uppercase, removing special characters, and applying common OCR error corrections (e.g., replacing 'O' with '0', 'I' with '1', etc.). The SelectBestResult function selects the most frequent result or, in case of a tie, the one with the highest confidence score.

\subsection{Feature Engineering}
For effective classification of the extracted license plate text, we implemented character-level TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization. This approach captures patterns at the character level, which is particularly useful for license plate text where individual characters and their combinations hold significant meaning.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Character-Level TF-IDF Vectorization]
# Create character-level TF-IDF vectorizer
char_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(
    analyzer='char',
    ngram_range=(2, 5),  # Use character n-grams
    min_df=3,
    max_df=0.9
)

# Transform the text data to TF-IDF features
X_train_tfidf = char_vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_tfidf = char_vectorizer.transform(X_test)
\end{lstlisting}

The character-level approach allows the model to learn patterns in the license plate text that may indicate registration status, such as specific character combinations or patterns that are more common in registered or unregistered vehicles.

\subsection{Model Selection and Training}
We evaluated several machine learning algorithms for the classification task, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost. The model training and evaluation process is as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Model Training and Evaluation]
# Define models to evaluate
models = {
    'Logistic Regression': LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000),
    'Random Forest': RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100),
    'SVM': SVC(probability=True, random_state=42),
    'Gradient Boosting': GradientBoostingClassifier(),
    'XGBoost': XGBClassifier(random_state=42)
}

# Train and evaluate each model
results = {}
for name, model in models.items():
    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train_tfidf, y_train)
    
    # Make predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test_tfidf)
    
    # Evaluate performance
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred, pos_label='Registered')
    recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred, pos_label='Registered')
    f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred, pos_label='Registered')
    
    # Store results
    results[name] = {
        'accuracy': accuracy,
        'precision': precision,
        'recall': recall,
        'f1': f1,
        'model': model
    }
\end{lstlisting}

Each model was evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine its effectiveness in classifying vehicle registration status.

\subsection{Web Interface Development}
To make the system accessible to end-users, we developed dual web interfaces using both Gradio and Streamlit frameworks. These interfaces provide a user-friendly way to interact with the system, allowing users to upload vehicle images for automatic license plate detection and text extraction or manually enter license plate text when automatic extraction fails.

\subsubsection{Gradio Interface}
The Gradio interface provides a simple and intuitive way to interact with the system, with options for image upload, manual text entry, and demo mode for quick demonstration.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Gradio Interface Implementation]
def create_gradio_interface():
    # Define processing function
    def process_image(input_image, manual_plate_text, use_demo=False):
        if use_demo:
            return create_demo_output()
            
        # Process input image and/or manual text
        if input_image is not None:
            img = np.array(input_image)
            plate_text = extract_plate_text(img) if not manual_plate_text else manual_plate_text
        elif manual_plate_text:
            plate_text = clean_plate_text(manual_plate_text)
            img = np.ones((400, 600, 3), dtype=np.uint8) * 255
        else:
            return create_demo_output()
            
        # Predict registration status
        prediction, prediction_proba, registered_idx = predict_registration(
            plate_text, model, vectorizer, label_mapping
        )
        
        # Create visualization
        result_image = visualize_results(
            img, plate_text, prediction, confidence, registered_idx, prediction_proba
        )
        
        # Prepare text output
        result_text = f"License Plate: {plate_text}\n"
        result_text += f"Registration Status: {prediction}\n"
        result_text += f"Confidence: {confidence:.2f}%"
        
        return result_image, result_text
    
    # Create the interface
    demo = gr.Interface(
        fn=process_image,
        inputs=[
            gr.Image(type="numpy", label="Upload Vehicle Image (Optional)"),
            gr.Textbox(label="Or Enter License Plate Text Manually"),
            gr.Checkbox(label="Use Demo Mode")
        ],
        outputs=[
            gr.Image(type="numpy", label="Results"),
            gr.Textbox(label="License Plate Information")
        ],
        title="Intelligent Vehicle Registration Verification",
        description="""
        Upload a vehicle image to verify its registration status,
        or manually enter a license plate number.
        """,
        examples=[
            [None, "ABC123", False]
        ],
        theme="default",
        flagging_mode="never"
    )
    
    return demo
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Streamlit Interface}
The Streamlit interface offers an alternative user experience with a more dashboard-like approach, providing options for image upload, manual text entry, and detailed results display.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Streamlit Interface Implementation]
def create_streamlit_app():
    st.title("Vehicle Registration Verification")
    st.write("Upload an image of a vehicle to check its registration status")
    
    # File uploader
    uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Choose a vehicle image", type=["jpg", "jpeg", "png"])
    
    # Text input for manual entry
    manual_text = st.text_input("Or enter license plate text manually")
    
    if uploaded_file is not None or manual_text:
        with st.spinner("Processing..."):
            if uploaded_file is not None:
                # Read and process image
                image = load_image(uploaded_file)
                st.image(image, caption="Uploaded Image", use_column_width=True)
                
                # Extract text if manual input not provided
                if not manual_text:
                    plate_text = extract_plate_text(image)
                    if plate_text:
                        st.success(f"Detected license plate: {plate_text}")
                    else:
                        st.error("Could not detect license plate text")
                        plate_text = st.text_input("Please enter the license plate manually")
                else:
                    plate_text = manual_text
            else:
                plate_text = manual_text
            
            if plate_text:
                # Predict registration status
                prediction, confidence = predict_registration(plate_text)
                
                # Display results
                col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
                with col1:
                    st.metric("Registration Status", prediction)
                with col2:
                    st.metric("Confidence", f"{confidence:.1f}%")
                
                # Additional information
                if prediction == "Registered":
                    st.success("This vehicle has a valid registration")
                else:
                    st.error("This vehicle's registration is invalid or expired")
\end{lstlisting}

Both interfaces provide options for image upload and manual text entry, allowing users to interact with the system in a way that best suits their needs.

\section{Challenges and Solutions}

Throughout the development and implementation of the vehicle registration verification system, we encountered several challenges and implemented corresponding solutions:

\subsection{OCR Accuracy Challenges}
\textbf{Challenge:} Initial OCR attempts produced inconsistent results, especially with varying image qualities and lighting conditions.

\textbf{Solution:} We implemented a multi-stage approach combining multiple image enhancement techniques, two different OCR engines, and result voting to improve reliability. The system now processes each license plate region with various preprocessing techniques and selects the most consistent result.

\subsection{License Plate Detection}
\textbf{Challenge:} Accurately locating the license plate region within vehicle images proved difficult due to varying plate positions, angles, and backgrounds.

\textbf{Solution:} We developed a robust detection algorithm using contour analysis, geometric filtering based on aspect ratios, and scoring mechanisms to identify the most likely plate regions. The algorithm considers both the shape and position of potential license plates in the image.

\subsection{OCR Error Handling}
\textbf{Challenge:} Common OCR errors like confusing similar characters (e.g., 'O' vs '0', 'I' vs '1').

\textbf{Solution:} We implemented character replacement rules and text normalization to standardize the extracted text before classification. This includes converting to uppercase, removing special characters, and applying common OCR error corrections.

\subsection{Model Selection}
\textbf{Challenge:} Determining the optimal machine learning algorithm for the registration classification task.

\textbf{Solution:} We conducted comprehensive model comparison and evaluation using multiple metrics, ultimately selecting XGBoost for its superior performance. The evaluation considered accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure a balanced assessment.

\subsection{User Interface Design}
\textbf{Challenge:} Creating interfaces that are both powerful and user-friendly for non-technical users.

\textbf{Solution:} We implemented dual interfaces with Gradio and Streamlit, offering multiple input methods (image or text) and clear visual feedback. Both interfaces were designed with simplicity and functionality in mind, providing users with options that suit their preferences.

\subsection{Handling OCR Failures}
\textbf{Challenge:} Some images had license plates that were too blurry or obscured for OCR to extract text reliably.

\textbf{Solution:} We added manual text input as a fallback option, allowing users to enter the license plate text when automatic extraction fails. This ensures that the system remains usable even when automatic detection is challenging.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

\subsection{Conclusion}
In this paper, we presented an intelligent vehicle registration verification system that combines computer vision techniques for license plate detection and OCR with machine learning algorithms for registration status classification. The system offers a more efficient and accurate alternative to traditional manual verification methods.

Our multi-stage approach for license plate detection and text extraction achieved an overall detection rate of 90.8\% and correct text extraction rate of 84.5\% across various image conditions. The character-level TF-IDF vectorization proved effective for feature engineering, and the XGBoost classifier achieved the highest classification performance with 95.3\% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.95.

The dual web interfaces using Gradio and Streamlit frameworks provide user-friendly access to the system, with options for both automatic and manual input. User evaluation showed high satisfaction with both interfaces, confirming their usability for practical deployment.

The system addresses challenges in OCR accuracy through multi-stage image enhancement techniques and provides a fallback mechanism for manual text entry when automatic detection fails. This ensures that the system remains usable in various scenarios, even when automatic detection is challenging.

\subsection{Future Work}
Several avenues for future work can further enhance the capabilities and performance of the vehicle registration verification system:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Real-time Video Processing:} Extend the system to process video streams for continuous monitoring and verification of vehicle registration status.
    
    \item \textbf{Mobile Application Development:} Create a mobile application version of the system for on-the-go verification by traffic officers and other authorized personnel.
    
    \item \textbf{Enhanced OCR:} Implement deep learning-based OCR models specifically trained for license plate text recognition to further improve extraction accuracy.
    
    \item \textbf{Integration with Vehicle Databases:} Connect the system to official vehicle registration databases for real-time verification against authoritative sources.
    
    \item \textbf{Multi-class Classification:} Extend beyond binary classification to identify specific registration issues, such as expired registration, suspended registration, or stolen vehicles.
    
    \item \textbf{Cross-Regional Support:} Enhance the system to recognize and process license plates from different regions and countries with varying formats and standards.
    
    \item \textbf{Edge Computing Implementation:} Optimize the system for deployment on edge devices with limited computational resources for broader adoption in various settings.
\end{enumerate}

These enhancements would further increase the system's utility and applicability across various domains, including traffic management, law enforcement, and security applications.
